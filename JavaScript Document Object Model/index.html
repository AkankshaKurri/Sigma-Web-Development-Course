    Document Object Model(DOM)
    Dom represents the page content as HTML

    Mapping is the entire document's inner object 

    this is used to change title
    this is used to change document background(inline css)
    it is used to print title in console
    it is used to print document body in console
    e.g. open console
         you can see there..
    -->     

    <!--
        Browser Onject Model(BOM)

        The Browser Object Model(BOM) represents additional objects provided by the browser(host environment) for working with everything except the document

        The functions alert/confirm/prompt are also a part of the BOM
       
       e.g.open console
           write window     //window will be printed
           write window.document   //document will be printed
           window.document.body    //body will be printed


        To change anything in the document  
        we can use "$0" to refer that object of the document
        e.g. select that particular object.
             click on inspect
             write $0   //to refer that object
             write $0.style.backgroundColor ="green"
             color of that particular objrct will change to green

    -->

    <script>
        document.title = "Akanksha is good" 
        console.log(document.title)   //console mei print hoga
        console.log(document.body)   //console mei print hoga
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green"  //used as inline css
    </script>
